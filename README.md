# The Kritter Family of Licenses

This is the Kritter License, a family of licenses that after a set period of time, makes your project go into public domain so others can use it freely.

As of now, the license is still on the works but there is a fork of the MS-PL license in this repository with the basis of how the license is gonna work. Think of it as a concept model.
